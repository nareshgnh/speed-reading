              "In today's knowledge-based economy, there's no better skill than
              reading and learning faster to be successful. I want to welcome

          <h3 class="sub-section-title">Why Speed Reading?</h3>
          <p>
            The tutor emphasizes that information overload is a significant
            challenge today. Learning to read and learn faster can provide
            benefits in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The workplace (managing mail, emails, trainings).</li>
            <li>Academic success and certifications.</li>
            <li>Personal development and maintaining mental fitness.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="sub-section-title">Proof It Works</h3>
          <p>
            A double-blind efficacy study using the Nelson Denny standardized
            test showed that participants doubled or quadrupled their reading
            speed with no loss of comprehension.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-section-title">Today's Tasks (from Video & PDF)</h3>
          <p>
            Your main task for today is to watch the introductory videos for
            Week 1. Once you've done that, you're set for Day 1!

            Activity: Measure Your Initial Reading Speed

          <p>
            It's important to measure your initial reading speed so you can
            track your progress. Follow these steps (from PDF Part 1, pp. 3-7 &
            Video):

              Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with
              Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's
              wife. <span class="word-count">(26)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be
              carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a
              roof, which made one <span class="word-count">(55)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a
              cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the
              beds. Uncle Henry <span class="word-count">(80)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed
              in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no
              cellar--except a <span class="word-count">(109)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the
              family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose,
              mighty enough to <span class="word-count">(135)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in
              the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the
              small, dark hole. <span class="word-count">(165)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see
              nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a
              <span class="word-count">(191)</span>

            <p>
              house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the
              edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed
              land into a <span class="word-count">(219)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass
              was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades
              until <span class="word-count">(245)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the
              house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the
              rains washed <span class="word-count">(271)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything
              else. <span class="word-count">(285)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The
              sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from
              her <span class="word-count">(313)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her
              cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt,
              and never <span class="word-count">(342)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her,
              Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she
              would scream <span class="word-count">(368)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice
              reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with
              wonder <span class="word-count">(392)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              that she could find anything to laugh at.
              <span class="word-count">(400)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night
              and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long
              beard to <span class="word-count">(427)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.
              <span class="word-count">(439)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as
              gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little
              black <span class="word-count">(466)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled
              merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day
              long, and <span class="word-count">(492)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.

            Today focuses on setting a clear vision for what you want to achieve
            with speed reading. This uses the principle of Newton's 3rd Law:
            "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

            <li>
              <strong>Reaction (Effect):</strong> The outcomes you expect and,
              importantly, how achieving these goals will make you feel.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The PDF emphasizes: "This exercise may seem simple, but please do
            not skip it. By doing this exercise, your goals become very clear,
            and by that, you will attain the belief that will help you complete

            "When you see something so often, your brain puts it into your

            Day 4: Expanding Instant Vocabulary (Fry Words)

          <h3 class="sub-section-title">Concept: Fry Sight Words</h3>
          <p>
            Expanding on Dolch words, Fry's Sight Word list is more modern and
            extensive.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developed by Dr. Edward Fry (1950s, updated 1980).</li>
            <li>Captures the 1,000 most common words.</li>
            <li>Comprise about 90% of words in typical reading materials.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Goal:</strong> Review all 1,000, focusing on the first 200
            for instant recognition.

            <strong>THOUGHTS ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS</strong><br /><br />
            This is an article about consciousness. We all experience
            consciousness, but what precisely is it? Let's look at an answer I
            know you'll really enjoy.<br /><br />
            For me, I like to visualize consciousness much like a cloud. A cloud
            that extends into the invisible universe that fills the entire
            cosmos and existence. This amazing thing is something each of us to
            experience during our lives.<br /><br />
            Think about this. When you are awake and perceiving what is going on
            around you then you are also conscious. You experience the
            perception internally of the amazing world that exists outside of
            you. It is as if both of these realms are merged through your
            awareness of their existence.<br /><br />
            When we arise from our sleep state each morning, we often experience
            a series of different levels of consciousness. First, we are
            oblivious to everything going on around us. Then suddenly we can
            aware and open our eyes. Soon you become aware of your body laying
            on the bed, and perhaps spend a few moments reflecting on a dream we
            just experienced during sleep.<br /><br />
            Now you feel your feet pressing upon the floor and become aware of
            the physical environment surrounding you. Things like the
            temperature and lighting in the room begin to seep in your
            awareness.<br /><br />
            Sleep isn't the only way you can experience a shift in
            consciousness. Sometimes you can experience an accident which can
            render your unconscious. Perhaps you are being put to sleep by an
            anesthesiologist during surgery. At other times you might faint or
            be ingesting something like too much alcohol or medication.
            Interestingly, you awaken very similarly to these situations as
            awakening from sleep.<br /><br />
            Habitual actions that we undertake throughout the day can also alter
            our consciousness. For example, did you ever drive for a long
            distance, and suddenly become aware that you've arrived at your
            destination? This is actually a form of hypnosis which is another
            conscious state. The repetitive actions during driving often put you
            into this special state.<br /><br />
            Sometimes our habits direct our minds towards something we desire or
            crave. Ever desire to have something sweet like ice-cream or cake?
            Your consciousness is reflecting on past experiences with these
            items and craves the pleasurable feelings that come from having
            them. This too is a form of consciousness.<br /><br />
            Sometimes a smell can trigger awareness of an event that took place
            years ago. Why? The smell center in the brain is very ancient and
            associated with our unconscious memories of events. For example, if
            you fell on a floor wet with Pine-sol as a child, the smell of pine
            might later trigger a fear of failing without you being aware that
            the roots of this fear lie in your unconscious past experience.<br /><br />
            As we mature, we become more conscious of our hopes, wishes, and
            feelings. Our awareness offers us the opportunity to change our
            attitudes, and create a more blissful consciousness as we move
            forward in life.

            <strong>THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS</strong><br /><br />
            There was once on a time, an old Goat who had seven little Kids, and
            loved them with all the love of a mother for her children.<br />
            One day, she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So
            she called all seven to her and said, "Dear Children, I have to go
            into the forest. Be on your guard against the Wolf. If he comes in,
            he will devour you all skin, hair, and all. The wretch often
            disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice
            and his black feet."<br />
            The Kids said, "Dear Mother, we will take good care of ourselves.
            You may go away without any anxiety."<br />
            Then the old one bleated and went on her way with an easy mind.<br />
            It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door, and cried,
            "Open the door, dear Children! Your mother is here, and has brought
            something back with her for each of you."<br />
            But the little Kids knew that it was the Wolf, by his rough voice.
            "We will not open the door," cried they; "you are not our mother.
            She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough. You are the
            Wolf!"<br />
            Then the Wolf went away to a shopkeeper, and bought a great lump of
            chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back,
            knocked at the door of the house, and cried, "Open the door, dear
            Children! Your mother is here and has brought something back with
            her for each of you."<br />
            But the Wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the
            children saw them, and cried, "We will not open the door, our mother
            has not black feet like you. You are the Wolf!"<br />
            Then the Wolf ran to a baker, and said, "I have hurt my feet, rub
            some dough over them for me."<br />
            And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller
            and said, "Strew some white meal over my feet for me." The miller
            thought to himself, "The Wolf wants to deceive someone," and
            refused. But the Wolf said, "If you will not do it, I will devour
            you." Then the miller was afraid and made his paws white for him.
            Yes! so are men!<br />
            Now, the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked
            at it, and said, "Open the door for me, Children! Your dear little
            mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something
            from the forest with her."<br />
            The little Kids cried, "First show us your paws that we may know if
            you are our dear little mother."<br />
            Then he put his paws in through the window. And when the Kids saw
            that they were white, they believed all that he said and opened the
            door. But who should come in but the Wolf!<br />
            They were terrified and wanted to hide. One sprang under the table,
            the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into
            the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the
            washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the Wolf
            found them all and made no delay, but swallowed one after the other
            down his throat. The youngest in the clock-case was the only one he
            did not find.<br />
            When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite, he took himself off, laid
            himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to
            sleep.<br />
            Soon afterward, the old Goat came home again from the forest. Ah!
            what a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The
            table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay
            broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the
            bed.<br />
            She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. She
            called them one after another by name, but no one answered. At last,
            when she called the youngest, a soft voice cried, "Dear Mother, I am
            in the clock-case."<br />
            She took the Kid out, and it told her that the Wolf had come and had
            eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her
            poor children!<br />
            At length, in her grief, she went out, and the youngest Kid ran with
            her. When they came to the meadow, there lay the Wolf by the tree
            and he was snoring so loud that the branches shook. She looked at
            him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling
            in his stomach. "Ah!" said she, "is it possible that my poor
            children, whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still
            alive?"<br />
            Then the Kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and
            thread, and the Goat cut open the monster's stomach. Hardly had she
            made one cut, then a little Kid thrust its head out, and when she
            had cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all
            still alive, and had suffered no hurt whatever, for in his
            greediness the monster had swallowed them whole.<br />
            What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother and jumped
            like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said, "Now go and
            look for some big stones. We will fill the wicked beast's stomach
            with them, while he is asleep."<br />
            Then the seven Kids dragged the stones thither with all speed and
            put as many of them into his stomach as they could get in. And the
            mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste; so that he was not
            aware of anything and never once stirred.<br />
            When the Wolf had had his sleep out, he got on his legs, and as the
            stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a
            well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the
            stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then
            cried he:<br />
            "What rumbles and tumbles<br />
            Against my poor bones? I thought 'twas six Kids,<br />
            But it's only big stones!"<br />
            And when he got to the well and stooped over the water and was just
            about to drink, the heavy stones made him fall in. There was no help
            for it, but he had to drown miserably!<br />
            When the seven Kids saw that, they came running to the spot and
            cried aloud, "The Wolf is dead! The Wolf is dead!" and danced for
            joy round about the well with their mother.
